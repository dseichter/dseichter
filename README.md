## Hi there 👋

My name is Daniel Seichter and at work, I am a Solution Architect with the speciality of AWS. Everyting I develop is written in Python or, if AWS, developed using terraform.

The software I provide (and the binary versions for Windows and Linux) used to be written in Delphi. I **migrated everything to Python**, which I like much more today.

One of my software, called VAT-Validation (now [VATValidation](https://github.com/dseichter/VATValidation)) was previously released as a commercial product. After refactoring, it is now fully released as OpenSource.

If you like any of my software, please feel free to give it a star ⭐, link 🔗 it on your website or tell your friends about it.
