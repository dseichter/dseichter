## Hi there 👋

My name is Daniel Seichter and at work, I am a Solution Architect with the speciality of AWS. Everyting I develop is written in Python or, if AWS, developed using terraform.

My software, called VAT-Validation (now [VATValidation](https://github.com/dseichter/VATValidation) was previously released as a commercial product. After refactoring, it is now fully released as OpenSource.

If you like any of my software, please feel free to give it a star ⭐, link 🔗 it on your website or tell your friends about it.
